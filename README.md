# ofxDynamixel
### openFrameworks addon for controlling Robotis Dynamixel servos using their DynamixelSDK.

This was initially made as a modified version of 
[https://github.com/ghiouar/ofxDynamixel](https://github.com/ghiouar/ofxDynamixel) although right now it is a completely diffent thing, just different, dont know if better. Mostly tested with the Dynamixels XL320 and sparsely with the AX-12+.

Currently the DynamixelSDK is compiled for macos, but it should be quite straight forwards compilling it for other platforms. If you do so, just put the compiled library (dll or whatever) into the libs folder and copy the includes, in case that you use a different version than the one I've added.

Developed with openFrameworks 0.10.
